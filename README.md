# Meta Database Engineering Capstone - Final Assignment

Welcome to the project repository for the final assignment of the Meta Database Engineering Capstone course. This repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to complete the assignment.

## Project Files

- `LittleLemonDM.mwb`: MySQL Workbench file containing the data model for the `littlelemondb` database.
- `Readme.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the project.

## Instructions

To recreate the `littlelemondb` database, follow these steps:

1. **Open MySQL Workbench:**
   Ensure you have MySQL Workbench installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official MySQL website.

2. **Open the Data Model:**
   - Locate the `LittleLemonDM.mwb` file at the base directory of this repository.
   - Double-click the file to open it in MySQL Workbench.

3. **Forward Engineering:**
   - In MySQL Workbench, go to the menu bar and select `Database` -> `Forward Engineer...`.
   - Follow the prompts in the Forward Engineering wizard:
     - Connect to your MySQL server using your username and password.
     - Ensure that the `littlelemondb` database will be created.
     - Review and execute the generated SQL script to create the database and its objects.

4. **Verify the Database:**
   - Once the forward engineering process is complete, verify that the `littlelemondb` database has been created.
   - Check the tables, relationships, and any other objects to ensure they match the data model.
